# Chess Game

This project offers a simplified implementation of Chess, crafted with vanilla JavaScript and webpack. It presents a browser-based, user-friendly chess game that sticks to the basics.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your local system:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.12.1 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.19.2 or above)

### Installation

Clone the repository to a directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oleksandr-basov/Chess-Portal.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd chess-game
```

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to engage with the application.

### Features

The project currently includes:

- Displaying a chess board with pieces
- Enabling the player to select a piece and visualize possible moves
- Enabling the player to move a piece

### Limitations

The game currently only supports pawn movement. Future enhancements will include support for all types of pieces, checking for 'check' and 'checkmate' conditions, and a mechanism to determine the end of the game.
